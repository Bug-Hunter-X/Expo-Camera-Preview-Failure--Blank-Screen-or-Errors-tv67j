# Expo Camera Preview Failure

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API. The camera preview fails to render correctly, resulting in a blank screen or error messages. This often occurs after app updates or changes to project dependencies.

## Problem

The problem is that the camera preview fails to render, showing a blank screen instead of the camera feed.  The error can manifest in different ways.  Various causes, from dependency conflicts to permission issues, make debugging challenging.

## Solution

The solution varies based on the specific cause.  This repository provides a few approaches to try:

1. **Check Permissions:** Ensure camera permissions are correctly requested and granted.
2. **Dependency Conflicts:** Resolve any conflicts between the Expo Camera API and other libraries using `expo install expo-camera`.  Also look for version conflicts.
3. **Update Expo SDK:** If using an outdated SDK, upgrading to the latest version might resolve the issue.
4. **Reinstall Packages:**  Sometimes a clean reinstall of packages can work.  Try `expo prebuild` then `expo start`.
5. **Verify Expo Config:** Make sure the correct camera permissions are specified within your `app.json` file.
6. **Simplify:** If using custom components, try removing them to see if they are causing the issue.  Try the camera in a simple context to rule out unrelated code issues.
